    Determines the directional orientation of a principal component vector.

    This function analyzes the components of a 2D principal component vector
    to classify its direction as one of four cardinal directions: "left", "right", "up", or "down".
    The classification is based on which component (x or y) has the larger absolute value,
    and the sign of that component.

    Args:
        pc (list or np.array): A 2D principal component vector [x, y]

    Returns:

    Example:

        >>> get_pc_direction([-1, 0.1])

    Note:
        - If |x| >= |y|: returns "right" (x >= 0) or "left" (x < 0)
